Render text tables for CLI-based dart applications.

Ported from Kotlin to Dart from Jake Wharton's [picnic](https://github.com/JakeWharton/picnic).

Work in progress.

Emojis and other wide characters currently are not laid out correctly, if the underlying Font 
displays them as 2 characters wide.
